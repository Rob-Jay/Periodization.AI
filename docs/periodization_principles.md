# 📚 Periodization Principles

This document summarizes foundational training science that powers the logic behind Periodization.AI. These principles are used to structure training blocks, adjust volume, and generate meaningful deload and adaptation cycles.

## 📐 Core Concepts

### 1. Progressive Overload
To induce adaptation, training must gradually become more challenging.
- Increase load (kg)
- Increase volume (sets x reps)
- Increase frequency (per week)
- Decrease rest time (in some cases)

### 2. Specificity
Training adaptations are specific to:
- Movement patterns (e.g., squats vs. hip thrusts)
- Energy systems (aerobic vs. anaerobic)
- Muscle groups

### 3. Recovery & Supercompensation
Improvements occur **between** sessions during recovery.
- Rest days are essential
- Sleep, nutrition, and recovery scores impact adaptation
- Deload weeks allow for recovery before resuming overload

### 4. Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) → Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV)
Each muscle group has a volume “sweet spot”:
- MEV = minimum sets per week to grow
- MRV = maximum recoverable before overtraining

> Example: For hypertrophy, chest might need 10–20 sets/week depending
