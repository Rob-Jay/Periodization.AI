# Deload Strategy Overview

Deloading is a temporary reduction in training volume, intensity, or both, designed to manage fatigue, maintain adaptations, and enhance long-term performance. It is a key feature of intelligent periodization.

---

## Why Deload?

- Accumulated fatigue can impair recovery and performance
- Prevents overtraining syndrome
- Allows supercompensation to occur
- Resensitizes the body to training stimulus

---

## When to Deload

- Every 4–6 weeks is a common heuristic
- After reaching MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume)
- When experiencing:
  - Decreased performance despite rest
  - Chronic soreness or lack of motivation
  - Elevated resting heart rate or poor HRV
  - Disturbed sleep or persistent fatigue

## How to Deload

**Option 1: Volume Reduction**
- Drop set volume by 50–70%
- Keep intensity (weight) the same
- Maintain movement patterns

**Option 2: Intensity Reduction**
- Drop load to ~60–70% of 1RM
- Reduce RPE targets
- Maintain volume

**Option 3: Both**
- Lower both load and total sets
- Focus on movement quality and recovery

---

## Active vs. Passive Deloads

- **Active Deload:** Light training sessions to maintain movement patterns and neuromuscular efficiency
- **Passive Deload:** Full rest or complete avoidance of resistance training

Most evidence supports active deloads unless burnout or injury is suspected.

---

## Typical Duration

- 1 week is standard
- In longer mesocycles (6+ weeks), a deload might span 10–14 days
- Can also be autoregulated based on biofeedback

---

## Special Notes

- Endurance athletes may deload by reducing mileage or intensity, not just strength work
- For hypertrophy: better to reduce volume more than intensity
- For strength: better to reduce intensity but preserve neuromuscular engagement
