# Training Volume Guidelines for Hypertrophy and Strength

This guide outlines evidence-based set volume targets per muscle group, based on training experience. It is designed to inform mesocycle planning, progressive overload decisions, and evaluation of logged workouts.

---

## Key Definitions

- MEV: Minimum Effective Volume — the lowest number of weekly sets per muscle group that produces gains.
- MAV: Maximum Adaptive Volume — the volume range that produces optimal results for most people.
- MRV: Maximum Recoverable Volume — the upper limit before recovery becomes compromised.

## Chest

- Beginner:
  - MEV: ~8 sets/week
  - MAV: 12–16 sets/week
  - MRV: ~20 sets/week
- Intermediate/Advanced:
  - MEV: ~10 sets/week
  - MAV: 14–20 sets/week
  - MRV: ~24 sets/week

---

## Quads

- Beginner:
  - MEV: ~6–8 sets/week
  - MAV: 10–14 sets/week
  - MRV: ~18 sets/week
- Intermediate/Advanced:
  - MEV: ~8–10 sets/week
  - MAV: 14–20 sets/week
  - MRV: ~24 sets/week

## Posterior Chain (Glutes + Hamstrings)

- Beginner:
  - MEV: ~6 sets/week
  - MAV: 10–14 sets/week
  - MRV: ~18 sets/week
- Intermediate/Advanced:
  - MEV: 8–10 sets/week
  - MAV: 14–20 sets/week
  - MRV: ~24 sets/week

---

## Back (Lats, Traps, Rhomboids)

- Beginner:
  - MEV: ~8 sets/week
  - MAV: 12–16 sets/week
  - MRV: ~20 sets/week
- Intermediate/Advanced:
  - MEV: ~10 sets/week
  - MAV: 14–20 sets/week
  - MRV: ~24 sets/week

---

## Shoulders

- MEV: 6 sets/week
- MAV: 10–14 sets/week
- MRV: ~20 sets/week

---

## Arms

- Biceps:
  - MEV: 6 sets/week
  - MAV: 10–14 sets/week
  - MRV: ~20 sets/week

- Triceps:
  - MEV: 6 sets/week
  - MAV: 10–14 sets/week
  - MRV: ~20 sets/week

---

## Summary Recommendations

- Volume should increase gradually week to week within a mesocycle.
- Deload should follow once near MRV or if recovery markers decline.
- Frequency: 2–3x per muscle group per week is optimal for most lifters.
